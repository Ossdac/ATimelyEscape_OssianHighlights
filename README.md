# Ossian Däckfors' Contributions to "A Timely Escape"

## Overview
This repository contains a selection of scripts written by me, Ossian Däckfors, as part of a collaborative project to develop the game "A Timely Escape" using Unity. While these scripts are designed for specific functionalities within the context of our group project, they demonstrate my skills and capabilities as a game programmer.

## Contents
The scripts cover various game mechanics and features, including:
- **Light Detection:** Managing light-based gameplay mechanics.
- **Checkpoint System:** Implementing player checkpoints for game progression.
- **Game Testing:** Tools for game testing and data collection.
- **Pushable Objects:** Mechanics for interactive game objects.
- **Activation and Start Mechanisms:** Scripts for activating and initiating game elements.

## Note
These scripts are part of a larger project and might not be fully functional in isolation. They are intended to showcase my programming skills and approach to solving game development challenges.
